## 🚨 **Rollback Plan**

### If Issues Occur
1. **Stop immediately** - Don't continue if critical issues
2. **Document the problem** - Screenshots, error logs
3. **Rollback to backup** - Use git reset or backup files
4. **Test rollback** - Verify everything works
5. **Plan fix** - Address issues before retry

### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Quick rollback to main branch
git checkout main
git branch -D upgrade/phase-1-security  # Delete failed upgrade

# Restore from backup
cp package.json.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS package.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
