# Phase 3A: Security Hardening Plan
*Generated: September 24, 2025*

## 🎯 Objective
Eliminate all security vulnerabilities and implement comprehensive security hardening measures.

## 📊 Current Security Status
- ❌ 4 moderate vulnerabilities (esbuild/vite/vitest related)
- ⚠️ Dependencies need security updates
- 🔒 Missing security headers and policies
- 📦 No automated vulnerability monitoring

## 🛡️ Security Hardening Tasks

### 1. 🚨 Critical Vulnerability Fixes
- [ ] Fix esbuild vulnerability (GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99)
- [ ] Update vitest to latest secure version
- [ ] Update vite dependencies
- [ ] Verify no new vulnerabilities introduced

### 2. 🔒 Dependency Security Hardening
- [ ] Update all dependencies to latest secure versions
- [ ] Add security-focused package.json configurations
- [ ] Implement dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Add automated security monitoring

### 3. 🛡️ Application Security Headers
- [ ] Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Add security headers in Vite config
- [ ] Configure HTTPS-only policies
- [ ] Add referrer policy controls

### 4. 📦 Build Security Enhancements
- [ ] Secure Vite production build configuration
- [ ] Add dependency integrity checks
- [ ] Implement build-time security scanning
- [ ] Configure secure deployment pipeline

### 5. 🔐 Runtime Security Measures
- [ ] Add environment variable validation
- [ ] Implement secure API configuration
- [ ] Add request/response security middleware
- [ ] Configure secure cookie policies

### 6. 📋 Security Automation
- [ ] Add pre-commit security hooks
- [ ] Implement automated vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Add security testing to CI pipeline
- [ ] Create security monitoring dashboard

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- ✅ 0 security vulnerabilities
- ✅ All dependencies updated to secure versions
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Automated security monitoring active
- ✅ Production build secured

## ⏱️ Estimated Timeline
- **Duration:** 2-3 hours
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Risk Level:** Low (security improvements only)

## 📝 Implementation Notes
- Focus on fixing vulnerabilities without breaking changes
- Maintain compatibility with existing functionality
- Test thoroughly after each security update
- Document all security configurations
