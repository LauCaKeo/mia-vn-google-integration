# Phase 3B: Performance Optimization Plan
*Generated: September 24, 2025*

## 🎯 Objective
Transform MIA.vn Google Integration into a high-performance application with lazy loading, prefetching, and comprehensive optimization.

## 📊 Current Performance Baseline
- ✅ Vite 6.3.6 with modern build system
- ✅ Code splitting: vendor (139kB), antd (254kB), charts (317kB)
- ✅ Gzip compression active
- ⚡ Build time: 48.26s
- 🔒 Security hardening complete

## 🚀 Performance Optimization Tasks

### 1. 🔄 Lazy Loading Implementation
- [ ] Convert components to React.lazy()
- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting
- [ ] Add Suspense boundaries with loading states
- [ ] Dynamic import optimization
- [ ] Component-level lazy loading

### 2. 🎯 Prefetching Strategies
- [ ] Route prefetching on hover/focus
- [ ] Critical resource preloading
- [ ] Image prefetching for above-fold content
- [ ] API data prefetching
- [ ] Smart prefetching based on user behavior

### 3. 📦 Bundle Size Optimization
- [ ] Tree shaking optimization
- [ ] Dead code elimination
- [ ] Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
- [ ] Webpack bundle analyzer integration
- [ ] Chunk splitting optimization

### 4. 🖼️ Image Optimization & Compression
- [ ] WebP format conversion
- [ ] Lazy loading for images
- [ ] Responsive image sets
- [ ] Image compression pipeline
- [ ] CDN integration for images

### 5. ⚡ Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Web Vitals implementation
- [ ] Performance metrics dashboard
- [ ] Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- [ ] Performance budgets
- [ ] Lighthouse CI integration

### 6. 🔄 Caching Strategies
- [ ] Service Worker implementation
- [ ] Browser caching optimization
- [ ] API response caching
- [ ] Static asset caching
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies

### 7. 🔧 Additional Optimizations
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Debouncing/throttling for user inputs
- [ ] Memory leak prevention
- [ ] Component memoization
- [ ] CSS optimization and purging

## 🎯 Performance Targets
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Bundle size reduction**: 20-30%
- **Loading speed improvement**: 40-60%

## ⏱️ Estimated Timeline
- **Duration:** 4-6 hours
- **Complexity:** Medium-High
- **Risk Level:** Low (non-breaking optimizations)

## 📝 Success Criteria
- ✅ All Core Web Vitals in green
- ✅ Lighthouse score > 95
- ✅ Bundle size reduced by 20%+
- ✅ Loading time improved by 40%+
- ✅ Zero breaking changes
- ✅ Performance monitoring active
